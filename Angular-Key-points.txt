# Angular Learning Path 2020

## Fundamentals

### 1. Angular CLI
The Angular CLI is the official command-line interface for Angular. It simplifies the development process by automating common tasks. It allows you to:
- Generate components, services, and pipes: For example, `ng generate component my-component`.
- Build and serve the application locally with live reload: `ng serve` is used to start a development server.
- Create new Angular projects with best practices built-in: `ng new my-app`.
- Build the project for production: `ng build --prod` creates an optimized version of the app for deployment.

### 2. NgModules
An NgModule organizes an Angular application into cohesive blocks of functionality. Every Angular app has a root module (often called AppModule), which bootstraps the app.

NgModules contain:
- Components, services, directives, and pipes.
- Import other modules.
- Example: The BrowserModule is essential for any browser-based app and should be included in the root module.

### 3. Components
Components are the building blocks of Angular applications. Each component consists of:
- **Class**: Contains logic and data.
- **Template**: Defines the HTML view.
- **Metadata**: Provided through @Component decorator to configure the component.
- **Binding**:
  - **Property Binding**: Binds properties of the component to DOM properties.
  - **Event Binding**: Listen for events like clicks and keypresses.
  - **Two-way Binding**: Combine property and event binding for forms.

### 4. Template Syntax
Angular provides a specific syntax to bind data from component classes to templates. Key concepts:
- **Interpolation ({{}}):** Inserts dynamic values into templates.
- **Property Binding ([prop]):** Dynamically bind properties like `[disabled]` for buttons.
- **Event Binding ((event)):** Bind events like `(click)="method()"` to call methods in the component class.

### 5. Directives
Directives are instructions in the DOM. There are three types of directives in Angular:
- **Structural Directives**: Change the structure of the DOM by adding or removing elements.
  - `*ngIf`: Conditionally add or remove elements.
  - `*ngFor`: Loop through arrays and render elements for each item.
  - `*ngSwitch`: Display elements based on a matching expression.
- **Attribute Directives**: Change the appearance or behavior of an element without altering its structure.
  - `ngClass`: Dynamically bind classes.
  - `ngStyle`: Dynamically bind inline styles.

### 6. Component Styling
Angular offers the ability to style components using:
- **Inline Styles**: You can write CSS directly in the styles array in the component.
- **External Styles**: Link to external stylesheets or include them in the styleUrls array.
- **Style Binding**: Use `[style]` to bind style properties dynamically.
- **Class Binding**: Use `[class]` to bind CSS classes dynamically.

### 7. Component Interaction
Components often need to communicate with each other. Angular provides mechanisms for:
- `@Input()`: Passing data from a parent component to a child component.
- `@Output()`: Allows child components to send data to their parent via event emitters.

### 8. Lifecycle Methods
Angular components have a lifecycle, managed by specific hooks. Common lifecycle hooks include:
- `ngOnInit()`: Invoked after the component's data-bound properties are initialized. Use this for initialization logic.
- `ngOnChanges()`: Invoked whenever the component’s input properties change.
- `ngOnDestroy()`: Invoked just before the component is destroyed. Use this for cleanup.

## Ecosystem

### 1. State Management (NgRx)
NgRx is a state management library that implements the Redux pattern in Angular. It is used to manage global application states by using actions, reducers, and stores.
- **Actions**: Represent an event (e.g., ADD_TODO, REMOVE_TODO).
- **Reducers**: Handle the state changes based on the action types.
- **Store**: Holds the application's state in a single place.
- **Selectors**: Help retrieve specific pieces of the state.
- **Effects**: Side effects that occur outside of the component (like API requests) and respond with new actions.

### 2. UI Library (Angular Material)
Angular Material provides pre-built components following the Material Design guidelines. It simplifies UI design with ready-to-use components like:
- **Buttons**: `mat-button`.
- **Input fields**: `mat-input`.
- **Dialogs**: `mat-dialog`.
- **Navigation**: `mat-sidenav` (side navigation).
It also includes a powerful CSS framework for styling, responsive layouts, and accessibility.

### 3. Server-Side Rendering (Angular Universal)
Angular Universal allows Angular apps to render on the server side, which can improve the performance and SEO of an application.
- **SEO Benefits**: Pre-renders HTML, making it more crawlable by search engines.
- **Improved Load Times**: Faster first paint for users on slow networks.
- **How it works**: Server-side rendering (SSR) generates static HTML at the server and serves it to the browser.

### 4. Testing
Testing is an integral part of Angular development. Angular supports different types of testing:
- **Unit Testing (Jasmine, Karma)**:
  - **Jasmine**: The testing framework for writing unit tests.
  - **Karma**: The test runner used to run tests in a browser environment.
- **End-to-End Testing (Protractor)**: Simulates real-world user interaction to test the entire workflow of an Angular application.

### 5. Miscellaneous
- **i18n (Internationalization)**: Angular’s built-in tools allow apps to support multiple languages.
- **Accessibility**: Ensuring your app is usable by people with disabilities through tools like ARIA (Accessible Rich Internet Applications) and proper keyboard navigation.

## Advanced

### 1. Services
Services are a way to share logic across multiple components. They are often used for:
- **Dependency Injection (DI)**: Angular's mechanism for injecting services into components or other services.
- **Providing Services**: Define a service and inject it into components using `@Injectable()` decorator.
- **Common Use Cases**: Fetching data from an API, shared business logic, or utility functions.

### 2. Observables (RxJS)
Observables are a key concept in Angular for handling asynchronous data streams. RxJS (Reactive Extensions for JavaScript) is the library that provides operators for working with Observables.
- **Subscribing to Observables**: Components subscribe to an observable to get the emitted data.
- **Operators**: Transform or filter data (e.g., `map()`, `filter()`, `switchMap()`).
- **Managing Streams**: You can chain multiple operators to create complex data pipelines.

### 3. HTTP Client
The Angular HttpClient service provides an easy way to make HTTP requests. You can perform HTTP operations such as:
- **GET**: Retrieve data from the server.
- **POST**: Send data to the server.
- **PUT, DELETE**: Update or remove data on the server.
- **Error Handling**: Handle HTTP errors using `catchError()`.
- **Interceptors**: Modify HTTP requests globally (e.g., to add authentication tokens).

### 4. Forms
Angular offers two approaches for working with forms:
- **Template-Driven Forms**:
  - Simplest method for forms.
  - Use Angular directives like `ngForm`, `ngModel`, and `ngFormGroup`.
  - Best for small and simple forms.
- **Reactive Forms**:
  - More robust and allows for more control over form behavior.
  - Programmatically manage form inputs using `FormGroup`, `FormControl`, `FormArray`.
  - Best for complex forms with dynamic validations and conditional logic.

### 5. Routing
The Angular Router enables navigation between different views within an Angular application. Key features:
- **Lazy Loading**: Load parts of the app only when needed (optimizes performance).
- **Route Guards**: Protect routes from unauthorized access.
- **routerLink**: Use this directive to navigate between routes.
- **RouterOutlet**: Marks where routed components will be displayed.

### 6. Animations
Angular has a built-in animation system, powered by the `@angular/animations` module. You can define animations and transitions using Angular's API. Common use cases:
- **State-based animations**: Change animations based on element states (e.g., expanding and collapsing divs).
- **Route animations**: Animate between different routes.
- **Trigger animations**: Fire animations based on user interactions (e.g., clicking a button).

## Conclusion
This learning path covers the essential concepts for building and scaling Angular applications. You will progress from learning the basic building blocks to advanced topics like state management, server-side rendering, and form validation. Each topic should be studied in depth through hands-on practice to master Angular.

### 36. DEPLOYING ANGULAR APPLICATION - CSR, SSR, SGA - ng build, dist file, SPA - single page appl - pros and cons
    - Static web host - FIREBASE - go to console - create a project - build - hosting - get started - install firebase - firebase login - firebase init - hosting feature - use existing project - select the project that has been created in firebase for hosting - public dir - dist/projectName/browser - yes for SPA - No - next - firebase deploy(run the build cmd first and also no space in firebase files)
    - And this will finally get the Domain link for the project
    - AngularCLI to deploy - alternative of firebase and also similar to it
    - SSR - SERVER SIDE RENDERING - ng add @angular/ssr - created a server.ts and much more - npm run build - dist - browser/server - and on running the server
    - getting error for localstorage as it is a browser thing and for we have - afterNextRender
    - SSG - STATIC SITE GENERATION - combination of above two - same for SSR cmds - change the routes in new txt file - prerender in angular json file - add object{} to it - set routesfile - txt file - this all for now

# Angular Tutorial Brief for the Angular Version < 16/17/18

## How an Angular App Gets Loaded in the Browser
- **app component** - `index.html` file - `selector` - `app-root`
- **main.ts file**

### NgModule, Component - html, css, ts, create a component - `ng g c` / `ng g s` (service) / `ng g d` (directive)
- **components** - it is like the tree structure of the project for eg: header comp, sidebar comp, main area comp like this
- **@component, export class, import, selector, template url, styles url** - the `templateurl` - html file, `stylesurl` - css file, `export class` - typescript file

### app.module.ts
- **import, browsermodule, NgModule, formsModule, httpModule, comp, @ngModule, declaration[comp], imports[module], bootstrap[app comp root], providers[services and all], export class**

### Communication between TEMPLATE and TYPESCRIPT FILE
- **Data binding, String Interpolation {{}}**, **property Binding[]**, **Two way binding[()]** - req - formsModule, **Event binding($e)** - `event.target.value`, using BOOTSTRAP

### SELECTOR
- **Attribute selector** and call like class to the template for having it to web page
- **inline styles** and **inline template** thing in the typescript file of the components using template literals

### USE OF DIRECTIVES
- **Structural Directives**: `*ngIf` and `else` (# local reference for else), `*ngFor` with `index/track`, `*ngSwitch`
- **Attribute Directives**: `ngClass`, `ngStyle`

### My Project in ANGULAR - MY_RECIPE_APP - BOOTSTRAP@3 - routing =false - standalone =false

### Debugging
- **Webpack file** in which our written code will be there

### Planning or Layout of the Project
- **Creating the components** according to the layout/planning
- **Main the Create the UI or USER INTERFACE** for the time being using dummy static data

### Components and Directives
- **To listenable or to have access from outside** we use `@INPUT DECORATOR` - from parent to child, alias, to emit from inside we use `@OUTPUT` with `EVENTEMITTER` - from child to parent
- **View Encapsulation, Local Reference, @ViewChild, Ng-Content, LifeCycle Methods, @ContentChild**

### Directives
- **Custom/Attribute own directives** - `@Directive`, `ElementRef`, `renderer`, `HostListerner` - `mouseEnter/over`, `mouseLeave`, `HostBinding`, `ngTemplate`, `ngSwitch`

### Dependency and Using Services
- **services, Hierarchical Injector, Consturctor, providers, inject, @Injectable** - services into services, slice, splice, push, pop, shift, unshift, and many more....

### Routing In Angular
- **Routes, path, components, routerLink, routerLinkActive, RouterModule.forRoot(), Router-outlet, routerLinkActiveOptions - exact = true, navigate or navigateByUrl, relativeTo, ActivatedRoute, :id, snapshot - params, params, subscribe and unsubscribe, queryParameters - allowEdit, fragment, Children**
- **queryParamsHandlings, Redirecting and WildCards(**), PathMatch, RedirectTo, AppModule to appRouting Module**
- **Route Gaurds** - `canActivate`, `activatedRouteSnapShot`, `RouterStateSnapshot`, observable, promise, boolean, `canActivateChild`, `CanDeactiavte`, Interface, Data message in routing part, Resolver, UseHash and many more ...

### Understanding Observables
- **RXJS** - Operators - Installing RXJS - third party package - various data inputs and according to the that we will get the output
- **Observer** - Handle Data - Handle Error - Handle Completion
- **params, subscribe, interval, unsubscribe, onDestroy, observable(), next, error, complete, pipe, map, filter, reduce, append, tap, subject, and much more ....

### Handling Forms
- **2 ways of handling forms (FORM tag)** - TEMPLATE DRIVEN and REACTIVE
- **Template** - `NgModel` - name, `Ng form`, `Forms Module`, `required`, `ng invalid`, `ng touched`, `ng dirty`, `ngSubmit`, `elementRef`, `@viewChild`, `Disabled`, `output error message`, `localreference #`, `Two Way Binding`, `ngModelGroup`, `setvalue`, `patchValue`, `get the values of the form which is submitted`, `reset the form`,.....
- **Reactive** - `FormGroup`, `FormBuilder`, `formControl`, `formArray`, `Reactive forms module`, `formControlName`, `ngSubmit`, `Validators[]`, `ngInvalid`, `ngTouched`, `ngDirty`, `get()`, `formGroupName`, `custom Validators`, `Async Validator` - (promise, observable, resolve, reject), `valueChanges`, `statusChanges`, `setValue`, `PatchValue`, `resetForm()`, `NgOnit`, and much more.....

### Pipes (symbol - |)
- **transforms the user input into desired output** like for example - uppercase, lowercase, date, currency and much more...
- **custom pipes, pure and impure pipes, Async pipes, also parameterizing pipes** - `date: 'fullDate'`, chaining multiple pipes, `.pipe.ts` - `@pipe` - `pipetransform`, `transform` - `value`, `limit`, `filter pipe`...

### Making HTTP Request to Angular
- **Interaction between FRONTEND -- BACKEND** - ANGULAR --> http request and response --> Store and fetch and update and delete --> Server --> REST API --> NoSQl/Mysql --> nodejs
- **Http Anatomy** - http verb - get, post, put, patch, delete, URL endPoint, header - metadata
- **FIREBASE** - create a free account - GO to CONSOLE - create a new project - databases - choose REAL time DATABASE - test mode - get URL - Perform CRUD on the URL - NETWORK TAB - STATUS CODE - 2 req - options and response - using Oberservable
- **HTTP CLEINT MODULE** - http client - post (url- end point - .json - reqbody) - subscribe - get the response, Get(URL- subscribe), Having Loading indicator, Having the Api Methods in a COMMON service parts with returning it
- **Error Handling** - error - message - catcherror - throwError - many more....
- **SETTING HEADERS** - httpHeaders - custom header - ADDING QUERY PARAMS - Params - HttpParams - set(), Observer, responseType - text, blob, ....
- **INTERCEPTORS** - Authenticate user - service - httpInterceptor - intercept - req- httprequest, next - Appmodule - providers - HTTP_INTERCEPTORS, useClass, multi, modification can also be done, Multiple Interceptor.....

### **AUTHENTICATION AND ROUTING PROTECTION IN ANGULAR**
- **how authentication works, CLIENT ---> send Auth Data ---> Server**
- **localStorage<---JWT token <----**

### Setup the Frontend
- **add the ui and be ready for the adding the server part** - if using firebase then change the rules according to the auth
- **refer to DOCS Firebase Auth Api** - there we will have the RESTAPI already for the use and according to the End points we have to call that api
- **For END POINTS OF THE API** we have to create - A service for the auth - create a signUp method and use http client post method for the ready api
- **add the API KEY to it and also add end point to it** - also create a response Interface for the response we gonna get from the api
- **same procedure goes for LOGIN Method as well** - `behaviorSubject exhaustMap take`

### Angular Modules and Optimizing Angular Apps
- **what are Modules** - it's helps to build a bundle of all the components and services and providers and packages we are having
- **feature Modules** - coreModule(Service) - sharedModule - component module - AuthModule - Lazy Loading - preloading Strategy

### Using NGRX for STATE MANAGEMENT
- **Third party package** - what is NgRx - how does it work - basics = state, reducers and selectors - working with NgRx Effects - reducer, state, actions, selector, effects
- **State management solution** - `ng add @ngrx/store` - reducer and store - `createReducer` - state using function - store - `$` and observable - constructor - select - aysnc pipe
- **Action** - `CreateAction` - increment - dispatch - props - on() - Reducer - `createReducer`
- **Selector** - state - counter - `createSelector`
- **Effects** - `ng add @ngrx/effects` to communicate with - http, localStorage and more..
- **appModule** - `EffectsModule` - `createEffect()` - `oftype()`- `withLatestFrom()`

### DYNAMIC COMPONENTS
- **componentFactoryResolver, ViewContainerRef, entryComponents, and much more...**

### StandAlone Components without NgModule

### SIGNALS

### Browser Animations

### Adding Offline Features to the Web Page
- **Angular Service Workers** - npm package - PWA - http-server - ngsw-config.json file configuration

### Basic Testing In Angular Apps
